# 2D-Array-Visual
I have been doing some programming problems involving 2-D array. Then an idea came up to me. I could create a create a GUI application 
to show visually how the solution to a 2-D array problem works. I did and this is what I have so far.

Currently, the program has flood-fill and A* path finding algorithms.
